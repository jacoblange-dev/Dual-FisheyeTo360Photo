# Dual-FisheyeTo360Photo

This is a project built in WinForms that converts a raw dual-fisheye photo from a Ricoh Theta S (size 1920 x 1080)
to an equirectangular projection and then renders that photo using OpenGL.

*Not* production quality code / software, fisheye-to-equirectangular logic lives in into MainForm.cs.

This project was completed for PSYCH221 @ Stanford https://online.stanford.edu/courses/psych221-image-systems-engineering
